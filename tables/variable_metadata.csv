,,"In this file, we define the variable attributes for each variable of the log file. In the first table we define which attributes should be included for each of our variables. Not all attributes are reported. Check https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#attribute-appendix for all attributes. We consider the NUG convention (standard NETCDF guide) and the CF convention (Climate and Forecast). The column M-O-NI it is used to decide the usage of the attribute in our dataset (Mandatory, Optional,Not Included). In the second table we list all of our variables starting from SWAMP v2 log file.

,,scale_factor,NUG,"If present for a variable, the data are to be multiplied by this factor after the data are read by the application that accesses the data. If valid values are specified using the valid_min, valid_max, valid_range, or _FillValue attributes, those values should be specified in the domain of the data in the file (the packed data), so that they can be interpreted before the scale_factor and add_offset are applied.",O,1.2,,
